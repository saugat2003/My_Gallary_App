# My_Gallary_App
The **Gallery App** is a Python GUI tool that lets users manage and interact with images of "friends." Users can view, add, or delete images, explore friends' connections, and switch between light and dark themes. Built with Tkinter and Pillow, it provides a simple and intuitive way to manage an image gallery.
